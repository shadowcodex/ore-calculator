# Ore Calculator

This pulls data from eve-central and calculates price and data. This helps miners
and industrialists determine what they want to mine.


## Todo

- Add JS SQL and use it to query data from the resulting data set
- Loop over ore items instead of just doing each one individually
- Use JS SQL to generate table instead of async responses appending(Will create more organized tables)
